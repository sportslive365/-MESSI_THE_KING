                Havig won 6 Ballon d'Or awards,6European golden shoes and over 35 
                career trophies with Barcelona,it is no surprise he is ranked as 
                the greatest player ever.However Messi is quite reserved unlike
                hiis greatest rival,CR7 and litle is known about him.Here is our top
                5 things you probably didn't know about the GOAT:

              <p class="pt-4 pb-4 mb-4">
                1.)Messi started his career at Barca at age 13.Messi left his 
                home country of Argentina with his father who remais as his agent,
                to sign for Barca.His first contract with the team was signed on 
                a napkin.Describing the situation,Messi said it was hard leaving 
                his family and friends to travel to a new country knowing that he
                was the family's bread-winer.

                2.)At age 10,his football career was threatened by sickness.
                At age 10, Messi was diagnosed with growth hormonal deficiency,
                a syndrome that prevented Messi from growing upwards.His father's 
                insurance only covered two years of his treament and his then 
                team (Newell) didn't payfor his hormonal treatment.
                The disease almost put an end to the star's career.

                3.)Messi is Barca's highest paid player in history.
                Having played for the club since age 13,Messi has scored
                over 474 goals in the La Liga and is Barca's all-time 
                scorer.However, late 2020 Messi indicated he wanted to 
                leave the club later retracting his statements saying:
                Barca was the club of his life.His current buy-out 
                clause stands at 700 million Euros!

                4.)Messi is the second player to surpass 1Billon dollars
                in career earnings.Forbes ranked him the highest paid 
                athlete of 2019 with France football referring to him as 
                the world's highest paid footballer.In 2019 he joined 
                Christiano Ronaldo to become the second athlete to make 
                over1Billion dollars in career earnings.

                5.)Messi wanted to leave the Argentine national football 
                team.With the end of the Copa America,Lionel Messi 
                expressed that he wanted to resign from the Argentine 
                national team,creating an outburst in his home country.
                Argentina's president Mauricio Marca urged him not 
                with the mayor of Buenos Aires erecting a statue of the star 
                so as to urge him to reconsider.Messi finally reconsidered 
                his decision saying that the love for his country was too 
                great.

                  Roccuzzo much like Messi has lived her childhood life in a
                  small Argentine town by the name of Rosario.She and Messi met 
                  through her cousin and Messi's best friend Lucas Scaglia, a 
                  professional football player at the age of five.

                  However, they soon separated with Messi moving to Barcelona,
                  Spain at the age of 13 to play for the Barcelona youth team.
                  Initially studying for dentistry at university level,Roccuzzo
                  switched to the modelling career and has since modelled for 
                  major global brands.On Instagram she boasts of having well over
                  15 million followers and fans.Even after separating with Messi,
                  they both kept in touch and would later have a re-union with 
                  Messi travelling to Rosario to comfort her after she lost a 
                  friend.Since 2008 they had reportedly been in a relationship
                  but it was in 2009 that their relationship was first made 
                  public.They both have three sons: Thiago(born 2012),Mateo(
                  born 2015) and Ciro(born 2018).
