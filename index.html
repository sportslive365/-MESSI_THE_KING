                      career trophies with Barcelona,it is no surprise he is ranked as

                      1.)Messi started his career at Barca at age 13.Messi left his 
                      home country of Argentina with his father who remais as his agent,
                      to sign for Barca.His first contract with the team was signed on 
                      a napkin.Describing the situation,Messi said it was hard leaving 
                      his family and friends to travel to a new country knowing that he
                      was the family's bread-winer.

                      2.)At age 10,his football career was threatened by sickness.
                      At age 10, Messi was diagnosed with growth hormonal deficiency,
                      a syndrome that prevented Messi from growing upwards.His father's 
                      insurance only covered two years of his treament and his then 
                      team (Newell) didn't payfor his hormonal treatment.
                      The disease almost put an end to the star's career.

                      Having played for the club since age 13,Messi has scored
                      over 474 goals in the La Liga and is Barca's all-time 
                      scorer.However, late 2020 Messi indicated he wanted to 
                      leave the club later retracting his statements saying:
                      Barca was the club of his life.His current buy-out
